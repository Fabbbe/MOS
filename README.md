# MOS
## The Original Mopperating System

A small x86 based operating system that currently does nothing. Run `make run` on 
linux to assemble and run the boot sector.

### Disclaimer
**Do not** try to use this as an actual operating system! Only test in emulators 
or virtual machines.

### Dependencies
This project uses **bochs** as a simple and fast VM to test the OS and **NASM** to 
compile the assembly code and **gcc** for C.
